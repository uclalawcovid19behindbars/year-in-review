# ideas! planning!

This project is made up of two main components: 

1. An executive summary, with static graphs to go alongside it, and

2. An interative (maybe animated?) data presentation

## Static executive summary graphs

- Show how many facilities we scraped data for over time
- Show aggregate counts over time (stacked facilities?)

## Interative / animated graphs

Narrative visualization, with the take-away message being that the pandemic has been devastating inside of prisons. 

- Compare infection rates inside and outside prison over time (risk-level comparison)
- Highlight a number of "representative" facilities where the types of outbreaks in time followed a certain pattern 
- Show ticker of the total number of COVID deaths over time 
- Experimental --> numbers, but no number labels on the y-axis??
